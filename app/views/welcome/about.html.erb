<h1>About Compass Dog Rescue</h1>
<p><div class="about-compass">Compass Dog Rescue is dedicated to rescuing dogs from high kill shelters, specifically in the south, and guiding them North (hence the name - "Compass"), bringing them into foster care until qualified, loving forever homes can be found. Please visit the Adoptable Dogs section of the page to see dogs currently in foster care and available for adoption. The dogs that are in the photo album "available for adoption" are dogs that are already here in Michigan looking for their forever home.</div></p>
<p><div class="about-compass">The dogs in the photo album "dogs in foster care" are dogs that are in foster care out of state, awaiting transportation here.At this time we do private, in-home adoptions only. The adoption process consists of an application, a phone interview, a meet and greet, reference checks, a home visit and an adoption agreement. The rescue will not deviate nor make exceptions from this adoption process. All of the dogs are spayed/neutered, fully vaccinated, heartworm tested (treated if positive, on preventatives if negative) and microchipped. The adoption fee varies based on the the age and history of the dog. We have a wonderful group of dedicated fosters and volunteers (but always looking for more) all helping to find these wonderful dogs great, loving homes.</div></p>
